# ASP.NET Web API with Docker and PostgreSQL

This is a template for building a web API using ASP.NET with Docker support. The Docker configuration includes a Dockerfile and Docker Compose file to run the application along with a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aspnet-webapi-docker-postgres.git
   cd aspnet-webapi-docker-postgres
   ```
2. **Build and run the application with Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    Copy code
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will start the ASP.NET Web API and PostgreSQL containers.
